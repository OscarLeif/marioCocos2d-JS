Mario Cocos2d-JS
====================

A clone of Mario NES using Coco2d Javascript engine. 

###Tools:
- [Python 2.7.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/)
- [Cocos2d](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download)
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
- [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/download.html)
- [Photoshop CS6](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)

###Sprites:
I took the sprites from: [http://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/supermariobros/](http://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/supermariobros/).
I edited these tiles using photoshop but you could use other graphics editing software.

###Audio: 

TODO

###Limitations:
- We can have just one `Tileset` in tiled map editor. This is because cocos2d limit you to have just one `Tileset` in tmx files.
- First commit or pull can take several time depending on your internet connection speed.

###Tiles
If your going to use photoshop to edit your tiles, please use RGB/16 as Image Mode and Saved for web as PNG-8 file format.
I was looking an error in tile redering just for that, it tooks me  hours; from lastest commit until now :/.
